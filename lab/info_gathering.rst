Exercise 3-1: Conduct a Whois Search with ARIN
----------------------------------------------
`:information_source:` using www.arin.net/whois to get information about an organization

1. Click on the link for the Handle **"MICRO-218"**
2. At the bottom of the results, the entry **"Net Range"** gives the **public IPs** for the organization

   These are the public IP blocks that need to be documented in the pentest report.

Exercise 3-2: Use theHarvester to collect email addresses
---------------------------------------------------------
`:information_source:` using ``theHarvester`` to collect email addresses and hosts IP addresses for an organization

On a terminal::

.. code-block::
   
   $ theharvester -d example.com -b all

The email and IP address need to be documented in the pentest report.
