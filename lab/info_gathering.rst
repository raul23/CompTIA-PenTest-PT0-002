Exercise 3-1: Conduct a Whois Search with ARIN
----------------------------------------------
`:information_source:` using www.arin.net/whois to get information about an organization

1. Clicking on the link for the Handle "MICRO-218", you can get a range of IP addresses
2. At the bottom of the results, the entry "Net Range" gives the **public IPs** for the organization

   These are the public IP blocks that need to be documented in the pentest report.
