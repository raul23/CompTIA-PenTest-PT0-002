# CompTIA PenTest+: Exam PT0-002

Resources for CompTIA PenTest+ (PT0-002) and related topics

[PenTest+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) is an
intermediate-level certification focusing on penetration testing (aka
*ethical hacking*)[^1]. PenTest+ covers risk analysis, threat detection,
and penetration testing and ethical hacking tools and methodologies.

## Four major phases of penetration testing process

1.  Planning and scoping

2.  Information gathering and vulnerability identification (aka
    *reconnaissance phase*)

    Passive reconnaissance (OSINT) vs active reconnaissance (DNS, port
    scan, OS fingerprinting)

3.  Attacks and exploits

    **Types of attacks:**

    -   social engineering attacks
    -   network attacks
    -   software attacks (e.g. SQL injection)
    -   wireless attacks

4.  Reporting and communication
