Resources for CompTIA PenTest+ (PT0-002) and related topics

`PenTest+`_ is an intermediate-level certification focusing on penetration testing (aka *ethical hacking*). [1]_ 
PenTest+ covers risk analysis, threat detection, and penetration testing and ethical hacking tools and methodologies.

Four major phases of penetration testing process
================================================
1. Planning and scoping
2. Information gathering and vulnerability identication (aka *reconnaissance phase*)

   Passive reconnaissance (OSINT) vs active reconnaissance (DNS, port scan, OS fingerprinting)
3. Attacks and exploits

   **Types of attacks:**
   
   - social engineering attacks
   - network attacks
   - software attacks (e.g. SQL injection)
   - wireless attacks
4. Reporting and communication

Exam Details (PT0-002)
======================
- **Exam Code:** PT0-002
- **Launch Date:** October 28, 2021
- **Number of questions:** 85
- **Length of test:** 165 minutes
- **Passing score:** 750 on a scale of 100-900
- **Type of Questions:** Multiple choice and `performance-based questions`_ (PBQs)
- **Recommended experience:** 

  - CompTIA Network+, Security+ or equivalent knowledge. 
  - Minimum of 3-4 years of hands-on information security or related experience.
- **Languages:** English, Japanese
- **Retirement:** Usually three years after launch

`:warning:` **Launch and expiration dates of the PT0-001 and PT0-002 exams**

 - **PT0-001** was released on July 31, 2018 and the English and Japanese versions already expired on April 26, 2022
   and January 31, 2023, respectively.
 - **PT0-002** was released on October 28, 2021. Usually the CompTIA certifications expire three years after launch.
   Thus probably around October 28, 2024, PT0-002 will expire.
