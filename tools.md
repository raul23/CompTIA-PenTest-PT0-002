#### Ping sweep/scan (`-sP` or `-sn`)

**Ping sweep** is a method that can establish a range of IP addresses
which map to live hosts (from
[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_sweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_sweep))

**Method 1:** `-sP`

``` 
$ nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```

**Method 2:** `-sn`

``` 
$ nmap -sn -T4 www.lwn.net/24

Starting Nmap ( https://nmap.org )
Host 66.216.68.0 seems to be a subnet broadcast address (returned 1 extra ping)
Host 66.216.68.1 appears to be up.
Host 66.216.68.2 appears to be up.
Host 66.216.68.3 appears to be up.
Host server1.camnetsec.com (66.216.68.10) appears to be up.
Host akqa.com (66.216.68.15) appears to be up.
Host asria.org (66.216.68.18) appears to be up.
Host webcubic.net (66.216.68.19) appears to be up.
Host dizzy.yellowdog.com (66.216.68.22) appears to be up.

Host www.inspectorhosting.com (66.216.68.24) appears to be up.
Host jwebmedia.com (66.216.68.25) appears to be up.
[...]
Host rs.lwn.net (66.216.68.48) appears to be up.
Host 66.216.68.52 appears to be up.
Host cuttlefish.laughingsquid.net (66.216.68.53) appears to be up.
[...]
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (105 hosts up) scanned in 12.69 seconds
```

**NOTES**

> -   ping scan without doing a port scan
> -   check the following sites:

#### TCP connect scan (`-sT`)

A **TCP connect scan** establishes a complete connection to the target
host by completing a **TCP three-way handshake** (from
[codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/nmap/tcp-connect-scan))

``` 
$ nmap -sT scanme.nmap.org

Starting Nmap ( https://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52)
Not shown: 994 filtered ports
PORT    STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp  open   ssh
25/tcp  closed smtp
53/tcp  open   domain
70/tcp  closed gopher
80/tcp  open   http
113/tcp closed auth

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.74 seconds
```

**IMPORTANT**

> -   \"the TCP connect scan takes longer and requires more packets to
>     perform\" (from
>     [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/nmap/tcp-connect-scan)),
>     i.e. more traffic. Therefore, it can be easily detected by an IDS.
> -   When [SYN scan](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html) (`-sS`) is
>     available, it is usually a better choice (from
>     [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html)).
